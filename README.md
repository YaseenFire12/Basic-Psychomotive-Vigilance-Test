# How to Install:
Download the latest release. The python release file should open up its window on its own.

# How it Works:
A red dot will, in short intervals, appear in the middle of the screen. 
As SOON as you see it, either click inside the tab, or press the space bar. 
This will continue for 60 seconds. Once it's finished, it will give you the average speed at which you clicked the dot.

# Purpose:
To determine the average visual reaction time of the user.
